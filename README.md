# portfolio-generator
## About
A generator to help build up a person's portfolio based on questions asked via a terminal.

## Motivation
The motivation for this was to learn and build up on the basics of back-end related to web-development.

## Problems Solved
It saves time in building a professional portfolio.

## What I learned
I learned how to make and run a terminal project using JavaScript and NodeJS.

## How to use
This will require using NodeJS to run. When you run the program, there will be a series of questions that you will need to answer, though some questions are not required and therefor are optional to use.
